# 📝 Survey Form

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.
The objective was to build a survey form using only HTML and CSS.

The form is designed to collect user feedback regarding website development and services. It focuses on clean structure, accessibility, and a responsive layout that works seamlessly across devices.

## ✨ Features

- Responsive design that adapts to desktop and mobile screens.

- Input fields with validation (name, email, age).

- Dropdown menu for selecting role (Client, Employer, Developer, Other).

- Radio buttons for recommendations.

- Checkboxes for selecting favorite website features.

- Comments textarea with character limit.

- Futuristic UI design with Orbitron and Oxanium fonts.

- Blurred, darkened background effect for readability.
